# The idea is to develop an e commerce using ReactJS :)

# Name / Brand

Maria de tomaso e-commerce. Special thanks to the brand for all images and information

# Developer

Maria Laura Bisaccia

# Styles

React bootstrap

# Tools used to build it

- **ReactJS**
- **Create React App** 
- **React Router DOM** - As it is handy to perform navigation between components which through easy-to-use hooks, we can implement various forms of navigation between components
- **Firebase's Firestore** - Used as there is no backend envolved in this project. It is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database where you can create subcollections within documents and create hierarchical data structures that scale as your database grows
